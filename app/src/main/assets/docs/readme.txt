I. Description

MyYatra is an Android app to find the shortest round trip route while visiting
a random collection of cities from a larger collection of cities. The computer
finds a route while the player finds a similar route.

Both routes are shown for comparison with the differences in round trip distances.

II. System Requirement

Min. SDK Version:   10  Version 2.3.6
Target SDK Version: 21

III. Known Issues and workarounds

The latitude and longitude of cities is not accurate. Map projections have not been
used and therefore the lat. and lon. of some cities is manipulated to be located in a
known location on the map.
